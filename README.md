## How to run the program locally

First thing you need is to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) Installed
In the Git Bash terminal, clone this repository using,
> git clone https://github.com/Zenthos/Chess-Application

Then open up two separate terminals and install the dependencies for both the client and the server
The package manager I used is `yarn`.
> yarn install

Then for the server (not needed for client), you would compile the typescript code into javascript with
> yarn build

Then for both of your terminals, start the server and a client instance using
> yarn start

And Thats It! You should have a working SPA running on your machine locally.
> http://localhost:3000/
