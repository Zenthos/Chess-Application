A Chess application allowing you to player with other people, and talk through chat rooms.
The game can be played at https://chessrooms.herokuapp.com/ 

## Built Using the MERN framework

#### What is MERN?
- M = Mongoose

- R = React
- N = Node.js

#### Other important libraries used
- Socket.io
- React-Bootstrap

## How to run the program locally

First thing you need is to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) Installed
In the Git Bash terminal, clone this repository using,
> git clone https://github.com/Zenthos/Chess-Application

Then install the dependencies by entering the command,
>npm install

Next open up two separate command prompts and have both cd into the directory you cloned this repository into.
In one terminal enter,
>npm run dev 

In the other terminal, run these two commands
>cd client

>npm start

The React client should automatically open a web browser and you can see the website locally

### How to help

This is a solo side project i'd like to work on by myself, but I would like for anyone who sees this repository to submit an issue if you think something I wrote could be improved upon or methods in which I could make my code cleaner and easier to read.
